# Assignment 3: Incarceration
In this assignment, you'll create the necessary files to perform the analysis described on Canvas (including `analysis.R`, `index.Rmd`, and by _knitting_ your document, an `index.html` file).

Once you have completed your report, make sure to **change your repository settings** so that you can view the hosted website (which will be available at https://ORGANIZATION_NAME.github.io/REPO_NAME)
